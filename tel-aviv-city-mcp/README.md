# tel-aviv-city-mcp

Part of [skills-il](https://github.com/skills-il): browse all Israeli MCP servers at [agentskills.co.il/mcp](https://agentskills.co.il/mcp).


An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that wraps Tel Aviv Municipality's open data APIs. It provides tools for querying real-time city data including parking availability, bike sharing stations, road closures, nearby municipal services, and cultural venues.

## Install

```bash
npx -y @skills-il/tel-aviv-city-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tel-aviv-city": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@skills-il/tel-aviv-city-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add tel-aviv-city npx -- -y @skills-il/tel-aviv-city-mcp
```

## Data Source

All data comes from the Tel Aviv Municipality ArcGIS REST services at `gisn.tel-aviv.gov.il`. These are public endpoints that require no authentication. The data is maintained by the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality and updated regularly.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tel-aviv-city": {
      "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@skills-il/tel-aviv-city-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage with Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add tel-aviv-city npx -- -y @skills-il/tel-aviv-city-mcp
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev    # Watch mode
npm run build  # Production build
npm start      # Run server
```

## How It Works

The server queries the Tel Aviv Municipality's ArcGIS MapServer layers using spatial bounding-box queries. All coordinates use WGS-84 (EPSG:4326). Results are sorted by distance from the requested location and returned as formatted text.

### ArcGIS Layers Used

| Layer ID | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 556 | Public Parking | Licensed public parking lots |
| 970 | Ahuzot HaHof Parking | Municipal parking lots with pricing |
| 835 | Tel-O-Fun Stations | Bike sharing station availability |
| 852 | Road Works (lines) | Road closures and construction |
| 853 | Road Works (points) | Point-based road work locations |
| 564 | Pharmacies | Pharmacies with hours and emergency info |
| 769 | Schools | Schools for the current academic year |
| 551 | Parks | Public parks and green spaces |
| 553 | Community Centers | Community centers and libraries |
| 745 | Culture | Museums, theaters, galleries, venues |
| 696 | Playgrounds | Children's playgrounds |
| 565 | Medical Institutions | Hospitals and clinics |
| 563 | Health Clinics | HMO (Kupat Holim) branches |

### Rate Limiting

The client enforces a minimum 200ms interval between requests to avoid overloading the municipal API. Failed requests are retried up to 2 times with exponential backoff.

## Notes

- Location names and addresses are returned in Hebrew (as stored in the municipal database)
- The Tel Aviv ArcGIS coordinate system is Israel Transverse Mercator (ITM, EPSG:2039); the server requests output in WGS-84 for compatibility
- Bike availability data may show -1 when real-time data is temporarily unavailable
- Parking status data from Ahuzot HaHof may not always reflect real-time occupancy
